# Voice to base64 converter
I was looking for one online and couldnt find a good answer, so here one is.

## how to use
click start to start the recording

click stop to stop the recording 

click the playback button to hear what you just recorded

click submit and it will print the recording to console, theres some code in here for posting it somewhere, you can fill in that part.

if you want to use this, obviously go ahead, im not the cops.
would be pretty cool if you forked it or starred it tho, would really give me some dopamine
